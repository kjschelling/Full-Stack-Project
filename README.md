Purpose:  

This app was designed for modeling agencies. Using this site
the agency can sign up, sign in, change password, and sign out (login capibilities) .

While logged in the agency (user) can create a new
model. Update an existing model, show the current models they represent and delete
a model.

Planning:

When starting this project, I originally wanted to do client (user) goes through agencies that have many models.
I than decided to simplify it to agency(user) has many models.

- set up remote repositories and initalized my front & back end. Then start the user authentication.

- Once the auth was working, move to the backend.
- added my models table
- added the relationships

- Focused on creating the "model", and displaying the "models".

- When working, moved to getting a singlar "model" using the id and deleting a singlar "model" with id.

- finish styling and adding the final touches.

Future Iterations:

User Stories:
-User should be able to sign up and sign in.
-User should be able to access all the models.
-User should be able to update individual models.
-User should be able to search for a specific model.
-User should be able to create a new model.
